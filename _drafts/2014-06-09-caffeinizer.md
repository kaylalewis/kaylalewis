<p>Caffeinizer epitomizes our dependence on coffee while we work by providing a tie with a coffeemaker embedded within. Sensors read the pulse of the user and trigger Caffeinizer to brew coffee when the pulse reaches a certain low.</p>

<p>During the show, I wore Caffeinizer and participants touched the sensor on my wrist so that Caffeinizer could make coffee for them.</p>

<p>I focused heavily on ideas of branding and marketing the product as a way of life, not just an object in life. When people used Caffeinizer, they received a sticker that declared them "caffeinized."</p>
