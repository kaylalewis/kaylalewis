weight: 7
year: 2018
description: Illustrated observations of life, to the extreme
objective: I wrestle with my impulses to be dramatic and take everything too seriously by drawing pictures of people doing that instead. A person (or other animal's) expression during these moments is the main focus of Unhinged. At its core, I'm playing with how we project ourselves within our observations of others.
role: Illustrator
tools: Procreate
skills: Illustration, Observation
takeaway: I share these with friends and family, and we talk about how they do and don't relate. It's also always great to make someone you love laugh.
