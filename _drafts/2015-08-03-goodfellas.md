A couple months ago I came across a remarkably disturbing article titled ["Women are not capable of understanding 'Goodfellas'"](http://nypost.com/2015/06/10/sorry-ladies-youll-never-understand-why-guys-love-goodfellas/) by Kyle Smith. I'm not sure what the intent was behind it, exactly, besides being outwardly offensive to women–and a lot of men, judging from the comments.

I am pretty in tune with conversations around gender inequality, being a woman who works in the tech industry. I've found that the most successful way to get heard isn't to shout, but to speak in a collected, patient manner. That's usually pretty easy for me, but this article destroyed me because it was so obnoxious and did an awful job at defending itself. Smith pulls specific scenarios from the film to prove his point, but his arguments are basically the title of the article, reworded in ten ways.

Sure, the Goodfellas are all men, and the women in the film are portrayed as their wives, which also holds true in *Wise Guy*, Nicholas Pileggi's account of the life of the real Henry Hill. The status of women in mob settings is usually pretty domestic, while the men get to have all of the fun and violence. A lot of *Wise Guy* is actually told through Hill's first wife, Karen Friedman's, point of view–just as she narrates parts of *Goodfellas*. A dominant male presence in most noteworthy scenes is no reason to deter women from enjoying the film. What good is cinema if we only watch things we can directly relate to? And, I doubt that Smith has ever been involved with the mob. He doesn't seem to have the intelligence to get by for very long.

It becomes clearer as the article progresses that Smith has, in fact, no idea what he's talking about as he argues the main points of the film. He is very fixated on the idea of ball busting, a vulgar term that he can immediately cling to. Never mind mob dynamics, coming-of-age, or the meaning of family. To Smith, the film is about ball-busting mostly. And women cannot understand the jokes behind it.

I would give Martin Scorsese a lot more credit than building a nearly three-hour long film about men busting each others balls at parties–Smith also loves to bring up the party scenes as instances of men at social functions where they can drink and have fun without their wives, even though they really aren't about partying at all...they are about business transactions and usually end in a murder or two. Anyway, Scorsese is a brilliant director. He took *Wise Guy* and brought it into a cinematic light that held on to the basis of the story while building momentum that makes for the perfect beginning, middle, and end to the film. The character evolution is complex, making the mob seem like a character in and of itself, while still building individual stories for those who comprised it.

Scorsese grew up a sickly, observant child in Queens. His attention to detail at a young age led to masterpieces for the past forty-some years of his life. Even the lighter-hearted dialogue in his films is rich with clever wording and hidden agendas. *Goodfellas*, specifically, moves effortlessly from Tommy making jokes over spaghetti in his mother's dining room to him mercilessly killing the man that was trapped in his trunk the entire time and then proceeding to bury him in the woods. We see moments of camaraderie over trivial things, and we see Jimmy bawling in a telephone booth over Tommy's murder. These quick wins and losses are what makes mob movies so captivating to me: you can keep score, but it doesn't really matter, because the second people lose trust in you, points mean nothing.

I love mob movies. I love the violence and the skewed dynamics. I love that where you came from will always affect where you're going, no matter how hard you try to escape it. I love *Goodfellas* because "Layla" plays during a murder montage, and I'll never completely understand why. I love *Goodfellas* because it's quotable. When I watch it, it makes me feel tough.

I've watched *Goodfellas* close to fifty times. It's on record as my favorite movie. I can't really pinpoint why it's my favorite movie over *The Master* or *Life Aquatic* or other notable films. It could be the comedic top layer that rests comfortably over miles of darkness. Or, it could just be that Scorsese wins over Paul Thomas Anderson and Wes...Anderson. Regardless, I am a woman and I love *Goodfellas*. I was not introduced to it by my boyfriend, and I have watched it a handful of times with my best friend, who is a woman, too.

I intended to pull quotes from Smith's article and refute them, but pasting his words in an additional place on the internet seems pretty worthless at this point. Plus, people tore him apart on his own post, so I'm pretty sure he was made to feel miserable, or at least like an idiot.

So instead, I have compiled some words expressing my pure and undying love for *Goodfellas*, because it is a masterpiece to men and women alike.
