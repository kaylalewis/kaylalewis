"What if the fabric of space-time was actually fabric?" I asked as I set down my beer. It was around 10pm and Gabi and I were at Miller's again--a bar nearby the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where we liked to stop after teaching our late classes.

Gabi came to SAIC in the fall of 2016 as a scientist-in-residence, and we met up after I discovered that her work around quantum theories involved holography, which I'd been teaching. Our mutual interests in art and science was careening into collaboration. But first, we needed a project.

The Fabric of Space-Time project was to be our more absurd, playful one. We designed three sweaters based off three widely-accepted quantum gravity theories. I took pictures of my siblings modeling the sweaters, and we designed a website and some ads around our quantum clothing. But as we considered how we'd explain these theories, more questions emerged around the public perception and engagement with science.

Quantum theories are hard to understand. Since they are proposed at such a tiny scale, we can't watch them in action. The less-evangelized ones, Causal Sets and Loop Quantum Gravity in our case, are basically inaccessible to anyone not actively studying them in an institution.

I find it baffling that theories that claim to explain the fundamental habits of our universe require such a steep learning curve. String Theory tries to escape, with many books written by scientists hoping to explain to the masses. Some are more successful than others.

But why is String Theory the one who at least tries to reach the general public? Because, as Roger Penrose explains in his book Fashion, Faith and Fantasy in the New Physics of the Universe, String Theory is the most fashionable theory of its kind. And scientific theories, claims Penrose, behave similar to fashion.

This methodology can be stretched to theories within any body of knowledge. But for the sake of this post and containing daunting complexities of one, I'll stick to quantum theories.

The fashionable nature of certain theories over others gives them advantages in the field of scientific observation and experimentation. Namely, systems of experimentation in quantum physics that require expensive equipment like particle accelerators are built for the widely-accepted theories (like String Theory). Therefore, someone proposing a new, radical theory for how our universe works probably doesn't have the environment to test it, and financial support is difficult to find.

Penrose mentions how grad students in these fields are often encouraged to work with accepted theories, for the sake of supported research, and eventually, getting a job.

Not to mention, new theories that agree with accepted ones (e.g. their bases are in line) often skip experimentation and instead are judged based off elegance of math and other characteristics, avoiding the scientific method, simply because they borrow from something already accepted.

This limited way of working in the field of quantum science was unfamiliar to me until today. It makes sense: forking over a huge budget for something new and unknown is much riskier than something that's been studied for awhile. And although no theory of quantum gravity is proven true, ones like String Theory and Causal Sets have gained traction and support across institutions.

I'm sad for the student with a new idea that moves toward an older one for the sake of job security, but again, I understand.

Although I can't relate explicitly to working in scientific fields, lack of support around creativity and originality is a very familiar feeling. We need to emphasize and facilitate creativity in all fields. Stop referring to people that think up novel ideas as "dreamers." It implies that those ideas will never gain the traction to become streamlined. Why can't new ideas replace and challenge old ones? If someone is willing to undergo the rigors of the scientific process to validate an idea, they should have just as much of an opportunity as those working in what's widely accepted.

In the same sense that design has seen a radical shift when practiced through the same steps as the scientific method, scientific bodies could benefit from the act of play and open exploration that attribute to the success of art and design.

I see promise in current initiatives to blend art and science, mostly because when artists and scientists work together, they encourage one another to work outside of ways they find familiar. This I can speak to firsthand.

Maybe one day we won't be so bogged down by paradigms and the institutional lines drawn across subjects. In a more eclectic state, these subjects bleed into one another, with outputs that aren't attributed to a subject, but a group of people with unique interests and backgrounds.

The Fabric of Space-Time project is an attempt to shift scientific perspective toward supporting and cultivating creativity. We want to make these theories more approachable by starting with a playful interpretation of a theory and inspiring everyone to learn a little more. We also want to promote the creation of new ideas and highlight the validation process, or how a theory becomes fashionable.

We've begun putting content out there, but the project is far from complete. We evolve the project based off feedback. We take technical content and evolve it into what we deem more accessible, without compromising the integrity of the concept. Then we gather more feedback. It's a loop and it's fun and challenging. For me, it illuminates the tension between the objectivity that science claims to hold, and the subjectivity of us as humans who are constantly influenced by our personal experiences.

It's all so complicated and beautiful.

Gabi and I have been collaborating on the same two projects for over a year. Each one is more complex than we could've ever imagined, and that's okay. I've learned so much through our collaboration, and there is no end in sight.
