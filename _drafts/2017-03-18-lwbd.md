Living With Big Data is a performance and book made in collaboration with Lucianne Walkowicz. Text and images reflect arbitrary systems designed in efforts to give data some sort of meaning. We presented the images as slides and read the accompanying text during the variety show, Ghost Planet. The book can be purchased upon request.
