Okay, so you've got a pretty decent understanding of Rhino and the 3D printing process at this point. But, class is over and you'd still like to pursue what you've learned.

Chicago is a great place for digital I/O and design. The easiest option would be to outsource to 3D printing companies, because direct access to 3D printers is difficult to come by (even at SAIC). The same can be said for other output methods like CNC mills or laser cutters.

**Places to outsource**

<a class="two" href="http://www.3dhubs.com/chicago">3D Hub</a>

<a class="two" href="http://www.the3dprinterexperience.com/"> The 3D Printer Experience</a>

...but the great thing about outsourcing is that it doesn't have to take place locally. With a little research, you can find the lab that's best for your project, whether in Chicago or not.

There are alternatives to outsourcing, all with their own benefits and drawbacks:

**Makerspace**

<a class="two" href="http://pumpingstationone.org/"> PS1</a>

<a class="two" href="http://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2013/07/3d-printing-for-all-inside-chicago-librarys-new-pop-up-maker-lab/"> Harold Washington Library</a>

**Buy the equipment**

Team up with others interested and split the cost of a 3D printer. The MakerBot used to print your first projects was around $2,500â€“not too bad if divided.

**Build the equipment**

Increasingly, people build their own CNC mills and 3D printers. This method allows for customization, is cheaper, but requires the necessary skills. It is a great way to understand how these machines work, though. And there is a ton of great documentation online.

<a class="two" href="http://www.instructables.com/id/Building-your-own-CNC-milling-machine/?ALLSTEPS">Instructables for CNC building</a>

<a class="two" href="http://www.instructables.com/">Instructables</a> in general is a great site for projects and inspiration.

<a class="two" href="http://www.autodesk.com/">AutoDesk</a> is another company with great projects, software, and equipment.

**Learning software**

The <a class="two" href="http://www.rhino3d.com/resources/"> Rhino site resources list </a> has a great list of places to find tutorials, videos, documentation, and books to learn more Rhino.

Lynda.com is great if you're willing to pay (it is only free if you are a student at SAIC)<br>

YouTube pulls through with a ton of videos for Rhino and other programs.
