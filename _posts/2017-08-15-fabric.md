<p>“What if the fabric of space-time was actually a fabric?” This question is the inspiration behind <a href="http://fabricofspaceti.me/">The Fabric of Space-Time</a>, a faux fashion campaign that bases its clothes off various quantum theories. With prices like “the experimental observation of supersymmetry” instead of currency, and “customer” reviews by people like Stephen Hawking, The Fabric of Space-Time builds a language inspired by e-commerce and fashion to treat quantum theories as something we sell.</p>

<p>Science is often communicated in ways difficult for the general public to understand. The Fabric of Space-Time strives to build an environment for users to experience quantum science in fun ways without compromising the complexity behind it.</p>

<p>This project was done in collaboration with <a href="http://www.nature.com/news/entangled-photons-make-a-picture-from-a-paradox-1.15781">Gabriela Barreto Lemos</a>, a quantum physicist and artist.</p>
