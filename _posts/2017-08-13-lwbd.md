<p>Living With Big Data is a performance and book created in collaboration with <a href="https://www.ted.com/talks/lucianne_walkowicz_let_s_not_use_mars_as_a_backup_planet">Lucianne Walkowicz</a>, an astronomer and artist. The work is an absurd spin on the processes and tools available for the excessive amounts of data we generate and engage with every day.</p>

<p>Inspired by some data science modelsâ€™ methods of categorization that are unrecognizable to humans, we came up with our own nonsensical system for generating text to accompany a series of collages we made.</p>

<p>See two slides from the performance and their excerpts below.</p>

<p>Although the text was generated algorithmically and includes English syntax and grammar, the words fail to make sense holistically.</p>

<p>During the performance, we read the text and presented the collages as animated slides. We also wore a bizarre variation of business clothes, to build on the tension between order and absurdity.
