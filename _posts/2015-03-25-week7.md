Today we will build another site from a Photoshop prototype:

<a class="three" href="../../week7.psd.zip" target="_blank"> Photoshop file </a>

<a class="three" href="../../bill.zip" target="_blank"> Bill Murray </a>

But we will also animate elements on the site using CSS <a class="three" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Using_CSS_animations">Animations</a> and <a class="three" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide/CSS/Using_CSS_transitions">Transitions</a>, which are based off CSS <a href= "https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform" class="three">transformations</a> (like the 'rotate' function we used last week).

We will also demo HTML5's capability to directly embed video (and audio) into your page:

## Video

        <video width="1080" height="720" controls autoplay>
        <source src="myVideo.mp4" type="video/mp4">
        Your browser does not support the video tag.
        </video>

By removing 'autoplay,' the video will not start automatically.

## Audio

        <audio controls autoplay>
        <source src="mySong.mp3" type="audio/mpeg">
        Your browser does not support the audio element.
        </audio>


And don't forget to email some screenshots and/or code of your projects thus far to klewis6@artic.edu!
