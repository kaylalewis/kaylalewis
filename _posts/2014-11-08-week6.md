Rendering in Rhino has become more useful than in the past. Rhino provides a lot of nice materials you can alter, along with really nice lighting capabilities. For that reason, we will work primarily in Rhino for rendering still images.

It's important to be able to digitally realize models' textures and materials along with making 3D prints so that your vision for the final product can be completely clear to viewers. In the design and architecture world, projects are often presented this way when they are unable to actually exist.

<strong>Demo: Rendering the Magellan Spacecraft</strong>

NASA has a fantastic <a class="two" href="https://github.com/nasa/NASA-3D-Resources">GitHub</a> account with free models of many of its projects.

You can access the materials editor from the top or righthand toolbars in Rhino–the righthand one is the easiest to work with. Next to the Layers and Object tabs you will find Materials.

From here, you can add a material. Rhino has default materials like metals and plastics that you can choose from and manipulate, or you can create your own from scratch.

Once you've created your material, you can manually drag it to the object you'd like to apply it to.

*if you have a boolean union object, you can explode it to break the surfaces apart so that you can apply multuple materials to the object.

After the materials have been applied to your object, go up to the Render tab at the top of the screen. You can Render Preview, or just click Render and save once it's finished.

For digital renders, 72dpi works fine. If you intend to print, 300dpi. You can adjust rendering output in Render Settings under the Render tab.

<strong>Notes on Materials & Lighting</strong>

Rendering properties are completely reliant on light, just like our vision in real life.

-Materials should never be completely black or white because light will not interact correctly–e.g. you can't make white brighter, therefore it can't be reflective.
<br>
-Use point lights for the most accurate renders. There is a default sunlight which has nice effects, but you have the most control manually applyling lights. Spotlights look fake.
<br>
–Shadows add very realistic effects, and their appearance can be adjusted with lighting.
<br>
-Render tab lays out things well and provides nice icons to determine types of materials and lighting
