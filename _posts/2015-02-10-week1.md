HTML (hypertext markup language) is a language used for the internet that allows for responsive text (e.g. linking to another website) and embedding media like images. It's been around for awhile (since 1990), and has gone through many updates–most recently HTML5.

This class will touch on the many ways to utilize HTML, which usually means using additional components (like CSS or JavaScript).

HTML is the basic structure of any web page that you navigate. Keep in mind that its syntax is not just for your organization: it aids in the way the computer loads and reads the page. The document object model (DOM) comes up a lot in web development. It can be directly manipulated through languages like JavaScript, and it represents the tree that branches off into the different nodes of HTML–designating relationships within the page.

An example of a DOM tree would be something like this:


<img src="/img/dom.png"><br>
<a class="three" href="https://courses.cs.washington.edu/courses/cse190m/07sp/lectures/slides/images/dom.png">source</a>

With element nodes representing each branch.

In your .html document, it would look like this:

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
        <title>Simple HTML Page</title>
        </head>
        <body>
        <h1>A main heading would go here</h1>
        <div>
        <p>Some paragraphs would go here, within a div.</p>
        </div>
        </body>
        </html>

The elements are all housed within tags. **All tags must be closed. This is the most common error when webpages won't work.** Within the title, h1, and p element nodes, you have text nodes (e.g. "Simple HTML Page" in title).

These terminologies and relationships are important to consider when writing your first HTML page.


## So let's write our first HTML page!


Here is a basic HTML skeleton, which can be copied into a text editor and saved as a **".html" extension**  
This way, your computer knows that the text can be run in a browser.

        <!DOCTYPE html>
        <html>
        <head>
        </head>
        <body>
        <h1></h1>
        <p></p>
        <h2></h2>
        <p></p>
        </body>
        </html>

Text nodes can be added between opening and closing elements. Add text, and save the file as index.html in a folder made exclusively for your site. **ALWAYS HAVE A ROOT INDEX.HTML FILE.**  Computers know to look for this file when first running a webpage.

File structure of your website is very important to keep in mind when building for the browser. Things like images must be sourced from the exact file path in relation to the html page you are writing.

Let's also setup a folder structure to house our first website.

## **Text Editors**
It's important to have text editor that will note errors and structure. Any below work (Sublime Text and Atom look really nice).

  * Sublime Text
  * Text Wrangler
  * Atom
  * Komodo (for Windows)

## **Browsers**
Ideally, anything you write should work in all browsers, and there are certain modifications that need made to accomodate some browsers (most with internet explorer because it is the worst). For class, making sites that will work on IE isn't a pressing issue, but if you were building a professional website, it would be more of a concern.

  * Firefox
  * Chrome
  * Safari

**For next week:** play around with more HTML and really get a feel for its structure. Look at different HTML elements on <a class="three" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element">MDN</a>. Don't worry about styling things yet, but start thinking about how you want your first site to look.
