# Hosting, favicons, and jQuery additions

Today we will go over hosting options and protocol.

## Hosting

Hosting services require a yearly fee to hold and make your site accessible on the web. Domain names also cost money, with pricing based on demand for certain names and extensions (top-level domains).

<a href="http://mentalfloss.com/article/30583/weird-world-country-specific-web-domains" class="three">Weird extensions</a> that you see are most likely based off countries. See a complete list <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Internet_top-level_domains" class="three">here</a>.


Common hosting/domain register companies include

  * BlueHost
  * GoDaddy
  * DreamHost
  * HostGator

But there are <a href= "http://www.pcmag.com/article2/0,2817,2424725,00.asp" class="three">many</a> to choose from.

In order to get files from your computer to the host server, you need to use a file transfer protocol (FTP). <a href="https://filezilla-project.org" class="three">Filezilla</a> is a common program to facilitate this.

## Favicons

Favicons (like the Wikipedia 'W') can add a nice touch to sites, especially for branding. Safari and Opera support favicons in the search bar, but other browsers don't.

Apply this code to your head:

        <link rel="icon" type="image/png" href="/images/myfavicon.png" />

##Assignment

Find and implement a jQuery image slider and plug it into a page laid out like this:

<img src="/../img/week9.jpg" width="50%">

<a href="http://www.slidesjs.com" class="three">slides.js</a> is nice and simple. <a href="http://owlgraphic.com/owlcarousel/demos/one.html" class="three">Owl carousel</a> is also pretty easy with nice documentation. Or, browse for others and find one that's best for you--i.e. one you'd use in your own site.
