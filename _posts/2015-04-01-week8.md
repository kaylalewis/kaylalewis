<a href="http://jquery.com" class="three">jQuery</a> (whose motto is "write less, do more") is a JavaScript library that avoids the tedious structure of JavaScript by condensing syntax and providing quick solutions to a multitude of JavaScript-related tasks. jQuery comes in handy for things like smooth scrolling and parallax effects, which is what we will cover today.

Plus this into the end of your webpage: 

				<script src="https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/1.11.2/jquery.min.js"></script>

Or, <a href="http://jquery.com/download/" class="three">download jQuery</a> and include the file in your site's folder.

In today's demo, we will implement <a href="http://balupton.github.io/jquery-scrollto/" class="three">smooth/responsive scroll</a> + <a href="http://pixelcog.github.io/parallax.js/" class="three">parallax</a> effects into a basic page template. We will also take a look at <a href="http://www.google.com/fonts" class="three">Google Fonts</a>.
