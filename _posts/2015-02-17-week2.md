Last week we touched on elements used in HTML like p, h1, or section. They are always contained in tags <element>. Although elements sound like the simplest term, they are actually a subgroup of nodes. **Nodes** include all components of your HTML. They are the building blocks of the DOM model (we also touched on DOM last week).

In order to fully understand HTML, it's important to be aware of terminology and how to distinguish between types of nodes. This awareness helps with understanding hierarchyâ€“both in HTML and CSS, which we will cover today.

# Parent, Child, Sibling

HTML sets you up with a family-like relationship between elements. The same relationships translate to CSS, so when you designate styles, you can set up one for the 'p' child of all 'section' elements, meaning any paragraphs that are nested one level within a section will adopt the style.

We will get into these more complex relationships later in the course, but you can see how important your HTML structure becomes once you move into more complex CSS.

Let's look at Parent-Child relationships in HTML:

          <div> <!--This is a parent-->
            <p> This is a child of div </p>
            <p> This is a child of div </p>
            <ul> <!-- This is a child of div -->
              <li> But these are not because they are not direct descendants of div</li>
              <li> These aren't either!</li>
            </ul>
          </div>


You can imagine how these would translate to CSS, where you can specify something like every p child of a div is blue.

# CSS Basics

CSS stands for cascading style sheet, which is a fancy way of saying it's what gives your page color, font families, and various sizing and spacing capabilities.

### Class

  Classes are written in your CSS as .className, and plugged into HTML as class="className"

### Id

  Ids are written in your CSS as #idName, and plugged into HTML as id="idName"

### Margins

  Margins add space to the outer borders of your element. They are CSS properties and used in your CSS file along       with the selector.

### Display: Block

  Makes an inline element act like a standalone, block level (helps center images)

### Width

  Using percentages for width is a simple way to get a page that responds to various screen dimensions

### Text

  Styling text in CSS includes too many options to list, so play around with potential styles and refer to the "text -" properties listed <a class="three" href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/Reference">here</a>.
