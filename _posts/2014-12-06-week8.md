Keyshot is a rendering program that is really easy to use.

It's different from rendering in other programs like Maya, because it is constantly forming a render while you model (you can see it reloading each time you switch camera views or composition).

Keyshot accepts most 3D file formats, including .3dm, so you can keep the original Rhino file as is. If you happen to update the Rhino model, you can re-import it into Keyshot as long as it's under the same file name, and Keyshot will keep the materials from the original model intact.

Keyshot's straightforward UI has a few main componennts in the projects menu, which is usually located to the right on the main screen:

Scene
<br>
Materials
<br>
Environment
<br>
Camera
<br>
Settings

Today we will focus on using the camera and generating textures by going through both the Camera and Materials tabs located under project menu.

Some widgets at the bottom may also be helpful, namely Screenshot, which allows you to save the current render; and Library, whose components include

Camera
<br>
Environment
<br>
Collections
<br>
Backplate
<br>
Texture
<br>
Rendering

These have dropdowns with preset items to be used accordingly. The textures are especially helpful to add to models.
