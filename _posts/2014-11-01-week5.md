**Analyze**

The Analyze tab gives you all of the options you need to make sure your model is ready for print. You can check dimensions, make sure seams are correct, or make a bounding box so that your object stays within a size range.

The main Analyze functions are 

-Distance
<br>
-Length
<br>
-Diameter
<br>
-Radius
<br>
-Edge tools to correct edges.
<br>
Edges --> Show Edges --> Naked Edges
If you have naked edges, correct them–i.e. make it into a closed polysurface. Check this as you go instead of waiting until you're done modeling. It'll save you time in the long run.
-Diagnostics to break down characteristics and warn you if your objects are flawed.

**Additional Strategies and Commands**

Running down the list of options under "Curve" and drawing from predetermined points will allow for more control. 

*Remember, once you draw a curve, if you turn control points on, you can continue to manipulate it. Just because it's drawn doesn't mean it's the final product.

Use Edge Surface (EdgeSrf) if you'd like to build a surface over open curves.

Flow wraps object(s) from original placement to new curve

Flow Along Surface wraps objects from original placement to new surface

A lot of questions have come up about joining surfaces and edges. Snapping lines to points on the edges you'd like to connect and then extruding or building a plane is the most effective way (you can also do this with curves), and although it requires more precision, you are in full control, and that is ideal for Rhino modeling. Using the trim tool is also useful to make edges cohesive, but you must make the original shapes larger so that when they are cut down they can be the right size.


*The Help setting is a great way to navigate through the tabs at the top of the screen. If you begin to type in a command, it will highlight its place in the tabs–e.g. if I'm looking for "network surface" and type in "network" it will go through and highlight "network surface." It's great if you've forgotten the formal name of the command for the command line!

Help will also pull up the right bar of the screen and break down the functionality of any command you are using, complete with video. Very great resource.

And finally, some food for thought.

Is it really art?
