3D software – or CAD, which means computer-aided design – comes in a variety of forms and takes on many uses. It can remain within the computer, or be exported to 3D printers and CNCs (computer numeric control).

Some prominent 3D programs include

Many professions have specialized modeling software, like molecular programs, or plugins exist to go with the above programs.

Basically, 3D modeling is used to design most objects, buildings, etc. and it's a really useful skill to learn.

But so many different programs! Not to fear, a lot of the same terms are used throughout. Such as

NURBS (non-uniform rational B-spline)
<br>
extrude
<br>
interpolate
<br>
mesh
<br>
polygon
<br>
primitive
<br>
bezier curve
<br>
loft

Once you've mastered one program, catching onto others is easy.

Rhino is great to start because it's incredibly powerful but has a straightforward interface. It also allows for precise, clean modeling, which is a great way to approach projects--especially ones meant to be 3D printed. Maya is frilly and it can be hard to get down to the basics.

Grasshopper is a plugin for Rhino that allows for node-based coding, which helps generate things like fractal objects that rely on specific algorithms.
