What is this thing we're using?

3D software – or CAD, which means computer-aided design – comes in a variety of forms and takes on many uses. It can remain within the computer, or be exported to 3D printers and CNC's (computer numeric control).

Some prominent 3D programs include Maya, Cinema4D, Blender, Rhino, and AutoCAD (amongst many others).

Many professions have specialized modeling software, like molecular programs, or plugins exist to go with the above programs.

Basically, 3D modeling is used to design most objects, buildings, etc. and it's a really useful skill to learn.

But so many different programs! Not to fear, a lot of the same terms are used throughout. Such as 

NURBS
<br>
extrude
<br>
interpolate
<br>
mesh
<br>
polygon
<br>
primitive
<br>
bezier curve

Once you've mastered one program, catching onto others is easy. 

Rhino is great to start because it's incredibly powerful but has a clean interface. It's also very disciplined, which is a great way to appraoch projects--especially ones meant to be 3D printed. Maya is frilly and it can be hard to get down to the basics.

Grasshopper is a plugin for Rhino that allows for node-based coding, which helps generate things like fractal objects that rely on specific algorithms.
