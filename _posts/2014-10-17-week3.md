Week 3 is about honing in on the skills we have previously learned and practicing them. First we will build another demo device together.

Things to Remember:

Use curves instead of solids. Manipulate them to draw more complex shapes. It's a lot easier than trying to manipulate solid surfaces.

"Join" can be used to connect curves, but its specifications become a little tricky. <a class="two" href="http://docs.mcneel.com/rhino/5/help/en-us/commands/join.htm">Here</a> is the Rhino doc that describes the command. Basically, curves can connect but they can't be overlapping and have to be direct continuations of one another. Remember that join does not alter the geometry in any way. It just makes it easier to move things around.

Boolean union actually connects the objects geometrically, but it's difficult to reverse the effects of this command, so only do so if you're completely sure, and toward the end of the modeling.

Loft can be useful for joining curves, but it has more specifications. Be sure to select the curves you'd like to loft in order: front, middle, last. If not, the loft will look distorted. Loft can be found under Surface.

Remember that curves are always separate objects from the surfaces you create, so if you make a mistake, you can easily extract the curve from the surface, delete the surface, and build another surface using the same curve. Trial and error is a common method in 3D modeling.

Demo: Make a robotic spider

If what I've shown in class isn't enough, maybe this is the best inspiration yet:
