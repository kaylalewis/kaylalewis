Rendering in Rhino has become more useful than in the past. Rhino provides a lot of nice materials you can alter. For that reason, we will work primarily in Rhino for rendering still images. Today will add materials to our projects and you will have the option of bringing them into Maya to animate cameras and become familiar with the .obj export process.
