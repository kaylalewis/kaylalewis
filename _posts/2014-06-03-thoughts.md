"Can you put my thoughts in order?" is a compilation of stream of consciousness thoughts printed onto a deck of cards. It is to be played like solitaire in regards to color order and structure.The structure of the game imposes on their attempts and brings them between creative and analytical states, which mimics actual processes behind thought.

Watching people play the game and diligently try to put my thoughts in order was fascinating, especially because I can no longer remember the order of the cards myself. The magnitude and speed of our thoughts make old ones seem foreign after awhile.
