"Can you put my thoughts in order?" is a compilation of stream-of-consciousness thoughts printed onto a deck of cards. It is to be played like solitaire in regards to color order and structure. Players organize my thoughts according to the four suits. The structure of the game imposes on their attempts and brings them back from a creative to an analytical state, which mimics actual thought processes.

Watching people play the game and diligently try to put my thoughts in order was fascinating, especially because I can no longer remember the order of the cards myself. The magntude and speed of our thoughts makes old ones seem foreign after awhile.
