"Can you put my thoughts in order?" is a compilation of stream-of-consciousness thoughts printed onto a standard deck of cards. It is to be played like solitaire in regards to color order and structure. Players are to try and organize my thoughts by arranging the four suits at the top. The structure of the game imposes on their attempts and brings them back from a lucid state to a analytical state, which mimics actual thought processes.

Watching people play the game and diligently try and put my thoughts in order was fascinating, especially because I can no longer remember the order of the cards myself. The magntude and speed of our thoughts makes old ones seem foreign after awhile because so many came after.
