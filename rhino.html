			Into to 3D Modeling focuses on the use of 3D modeling both in and out of the computer. The class will go in depth to learn Rhino, a 3D modeling program, while also touching on alternative software. Projects will use the Rhino files to generate 3D printed models. We will also explore alternative 3D modeling outputs, such as 3D scanning and CNC tools.

			The class will have three major projects, with side exercises done in Rhino. The nature of the projects vary, and students are encouraged to think outside of using 3D software for technical objects and instead print objects with conceptual backdrops like nanotechnology from the future, or objects that are aware of their status as 3D prints.
