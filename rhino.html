	<p>
			Rhino and 3D printing focuses on the use of 3D modeling both in and out of the computer. The class will go in depth to learn Rhino, while also touching on alternative 3D modeling software. Projects will use the Rhino files to generate 3D printed models.

	<p>
			The class will have three major projects, with side exercises done in Rhino. The nature of the projects vary, and students are encouraged to think outside of using 3D software for technical objects and instead print objects with conceptual backdrops like nanotechnology from the future, or objects that are aware of their status as 3D prints.
