			Intro to 3D Modeling focuses on the use of 3D modeling both in and out of the computer. The class will go in depth to learn Rhino, a 3D modeling program, while also touching on alternative software. Projects will use the Rhino files to generate 3D printed models. We will also explore alternative 3D modeling outputs, such as 3D scanning and CNC tools.

			The class will have two major projects, with side exercises and demos in Rhino and other programs. The nature of the projects vary, and students are encouraged to think outside of using 3D software for technical objects and instead print objects with conceptual backdrops like nanotechnology from the future, or objects that are aware of their status as 3D prints. 

		</p>

		<p> <strong>Project 1 Part I</strong> <br>Design an object in Rhino and render it. This project will emphasize modeling within the computer and focus on rendering digitally.
		<br><br>
		<strong>Project 1 Part II</strong> <br>3D print the model. Present it with digital renders. Together, prints and renders should help us accurately envision your object.
		<br><br>
		<strong>Project 2</strong><br>Design a more complex object in Rhino that can be 3D printed. Based off of acquired skills in the class, try to challege yourself to create something both intricate and printable. It can be an iteration of your first project, or something completely new. Look at the Resources below for inspiration.   
		<br><br>
		Ideas for models: nanotechnology, medical, mechanical, living, chemical structure, furniture or building. Keep in mind that these are all scaled models of the real thingâ€“i.e. the actual invention doesn't have to be the size of what a 3D printer allows. Think of 3D prints as models the same way they are in a computer. Dream big or microscopic.
