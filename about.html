<h3>I'm an artist, designer, and educator in Chicago.</h3>
</div>

<div>
<p>I like making things, and I like helping people make things. Science and language are two common themes in my art, sometimes together. I've been making art since before I can remember, and I have over three years of experience as an interaction and data visualization designer in the IOT/analytics space. I've taught all ages, including undergraduates at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, where I received an MFA in Art and Technology Studies.</p>

<!-- <p>I am first and foremost an artist, and I believe in the value it brings to every aspect of my life. Art allows me to <strong>pursue any curiosity</strong> (from the periodic table to illustrating the Trump cabinet as swamp monsters), and to create pieces that are a culmination of my research and personal reflection. Art does not try to mask the subjectivity woven into everything we do, and I believe that candor toward biases and things I don't understand helps me to be a more <strong>honest and open designer</strong>.</p>

<p>My artistic background also taught me to be <strong>resourceful</strong>, and over the years I have acquired whatever skills necessary to carry out personal projects, such as the front end skills I have gained over years of building websites for my projects. Resourcefulness also carries well into my design career, where I propose new projects and initiatives, using whatever outlets necessary to get a vision across.</p>

<p><strong>Collaboration</strong> is a huge part of my creative work, and I frequently collaborate with scientists, because I am deeply passionate about communicating complex scientific and technical subjects to a larger audience. Within my design work, I collaborate with engineers and data analysts to understand and produce condition monitoring applications.</p>

<p>Above all, I am accustomed to <strong>making something from nothing</strong>. The seed of an idea has the potential to turn into anything, and I approach the possibilities with confidence. I carry this mindset into my design forays, where I have done things like create and manage a company's first design system team, and work to make employee-driven creative content an inherent part of a company's brand.</p> -->
