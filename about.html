title: About

Science, its language, and claims of objectivity have been the emphasis of my recent work. I am fascinated by the way we communicate scientific theories and issues, and I explore these areas through the creation of systems that mirror and build off of them. Projects have taken many forms, from a dictionary of words spelled using the chemical elements, to a fake company that uses DNA as currency to designate ownership of celestial bodies. Collaboration with scientists is also an important component of my work, and I believe that the relationships between artists and scientists help contribute new meaning to both professions. Through these collaborations as well as independent explorations, I hope to increase viewers' level of criticality toward science.

I graduated from Ohio State University with an English degree and am now earning an MFA from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. My focus is in Art and Technology Studies, which centers around the meaning of using technology in art as much as the technical skills themselves.
