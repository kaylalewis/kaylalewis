title: About
---

Current pursuits include chemical structures, outerspace, and the nature of language. I don't limit myself to one focus or medium. Everything overlaps with everything else, and that overlap is where my work lies.

I graduated from Ohio State University with an English degree and am now earning an MFA from The School of the Art Institute of Chicago. My focus is in Art and Technology Studies, which centers around the meaning of using technology in art as much as the technical skills themselves.
