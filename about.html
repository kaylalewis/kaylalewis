<!-- <p>Science, its language, and claims of objectivity have been the emphasis of my recent work. I am fascinated by the way we communicate scientific theories and issues, and I explore these areas through the creation of systems that mirror and build off of them.</p> -->
<p>I work as a designer at <a href="http://uptake.com">Uptake</a>, where I specialize in data visualization for advanced condition monitoring software. My background is pretty multifaceted and spans from journalism to programming. In my spare time I love to read about the future of space exploration and write stories that I'll probably never show anyone. I work with other people on all types of projects, so get in touch!</p>
