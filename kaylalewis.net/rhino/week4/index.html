	<p>Today we are focused on finishing the first version of our first project, which means that at the end of class we’ll have something to show–but it doesn’t have to be completely finished! We will also touch on some new commands for surfaces as well as layer organization in Rhino.</p>

<p>Here are some additional surface commands as your projects move from curves to tangible objects (all but one can be found under the Surface tab):</p>

<p>-Network Surface will build a surface that connects edges. All of the edges must form a grid-like structure.
<br />
-Sweep is like Loft only you designate a rail (or two) that the curve extends along. So you only need one curve and then one or two rails for it to follow along. The Sweep option asks how many rails you’d like.
<br />
-Boolean Difference is like Union, only it will subtract an imprint of one object from the surface of another–e.g. if I want to cut a cylindrical hole through a cube, I would put a cylinder within the cube and select Boolean Difference (from the Solid tab). Then, follow the command line directions.
<br />
-Split asks you to select the cutting object and the object to be cut from–e.g. if I have a plane through a cube, I can split the cube’s surface apart where the plane is. Trim is like Split only it will delete the part it is cutting off.
<br />
-Rebuild by turning control points on and then selecting or typing Rebuild. You can type in a new number of points to add to the curve or surface.
<br />
-Edge Surface will build a plane over open curves.</p>

<p>*Remember that it’s always safer to make an object too big, because you can easily trim it down. Objects that are too small require a lot more adjusting.</p>

<p>*Always pay attention to the command line instructions for clarification.</p>

<p>*Views become important when adjusting surfaces. I like shaded view because you can see both edges and the surface. </p>

<p><strong>These commands are fun but remember that putting a surface over many complex edges requires complex analyzing of the object so that it can be made printable</strong></p>

<p>We will also look more into organization of files now that you have a better understanding of Rhino itself:</p>

<p><strong>Layers</strong></p>

<p>You’ll realize layers’ importance as you continue working in Rhino. While they don’t change geometry or object interaction, they do provide a nice method of organization. Using layers you can</p>

<p>-quickly select a group of objects
<br />	
-distinguish each layer by the color of the layer, which is NOT the same as the object material
<br />
-make objects invisible in the viewport
<br />
-lock a layer so that when you select objects, others will not move by accident.</p>

<p>With these tools, you’re on track for some pretty great projects.</p>

<p>Also, 3D printed doge.
