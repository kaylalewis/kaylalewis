    <h1>Hey, what's up?</h1>
<br>
<h4>July 25, 2018</h4>
<div class="postImg">
<p>Over two months ago, I quit my job at Uptake and have since been focusing on Fabric of Space-Time, my latest art project, as well as traveling around the country. I started writing this long-winded blog post about everything I’ve done, but realized that I wouldn’t even want to read a play-by-play of my life, so I have reduced the last couple months to some pictures, with captions. Enjoy.  </p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/nyc/prenyc.jpg" />
Us before I drove us to NYC for my art show. I would not recommend driving into NYC. My Ohio driving education did not prepare me for the aggression and lack of structure in those streets. At one point I think I drove under a UPS truck. But, contrary to my parents’ predictions, we did not die in NYC.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/nyc/og.jpg" />
On our way to NYC we stopped at an Olive Garden because I missed their breadsticks. We thought this scenery looked like the hills of Tuscany. Perfect for Olive Garden. The breadsticks were shit.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/nyc/camera.jpg" />
This was during the show. It took place on Governors Island. We got footage of the clothes and Gabi and me talking about the project, which we are currently editing. Turns out I look like a Gremlin on camera. I have also discovered my mouth contorts when I talk as if I have had a stroke. TBD if I have had a stroke or not.  </p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/nyc/ambassadors.jpg" />
Emily and Donald served as ambassadors and recruited people to our exhibit. Here they are wearing the ambassador shirts I designed. They did great.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/nyc/donaldandkids.jpg" />
Donald loved Trey’s kids. I love this picture because they both look terrified and skeptical of him, although it is not an accurate representation. Donald is also a grown-ass man, which I had not realized until viewing these pictures.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/nyc/gabi.jpg" />
Gabi, who collaborated with me on Fabric of Space-Time and came all the way from Brazil, and one of the mannequins. This picture is also misleading because we hate those mannequins. They take up way too much space and are awfully cumbersome. They are currently in some NYC limbo state and we might need them back if we show again in Sept. but we don’t really want them.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/nyc/usinclothes.jpg" />
After the show we walked around the Airbnb in the clothes. I was happy to realize they look even better on real people. We had a lot of fun and are lucky we are tall like the mannequins.</p>

<p>Between NYC and Utah, I was in D.C. for a few days so I could attend my good friend Lucianne's unconference, titled Decolonizing Mars. I met the most eclectic, thoughtful people and witnessed amazing conversations about space and humans and life. So memorable, but I failed to take pictures. I did get to host a zine-making session, so hopefully those contributions will be shared in the near future as visual representations.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/cali/unicorn.jpg" />
These enormous inflatable creatures dominated the pool at Trey’s apartment complex in Utah. One day I will write a very philosophical essay about them. Something about these colorful animals being confined to a communal pool in Utah is very compelling but I’m not sure what yet…</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/cali/beach.jpg" />
From Utah we headed to LA… We didn’t get a ton of beach time because we stayed inland at Silver Lake, but what time we did spend was lovely.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/cali/run.jpg" />
We stayed in Silver Lake and tried to run sometimes. Trey will forever be an athlete and I will forever be an art student with low VO2 max.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/cali/dodgers.jpg" />
On the 4th of July we went to a Dodgers game with some friends. This stadium was impressive to me because of the surrounding scenery. There were some fireworks and bloody marys with beer in them instead of liquor, and they cost about $23.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/cali/art.jpg" />
One day it was so hot we couldn’t function and we were stumbling around outside and ended up at this art show, titled Beyond the Streets, full of really cool graffiti and other things graffiti artists had done.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/cali/puppets.jpg" />
The show also had a room of puppets. They were amazing.</p>

<p>I stayed in Newport for one night in between LA and San Diego, because I wanted to pretend like I was in The O.C. (the television drama from the 2000s). I walked three miles to Huntington Beach and got dinner at a 711.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/cali/airbnb.jpg" />
I want to do an in-depth study of Airbnb art because 95% of the time it is about amour or vanity and uses Curlz font or a close relative.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/cali/cheep.jpg" />
How could you not love this precious guy?! I saw so many of him and his cousins throughout San Diego and New Mexico.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/cali/walken.jpg" />
This summer I’ve learned to eat by myself at restaurants and have actually begun to enjoy it…more so when I eat at clever restaurants, like this one in Encinitas (the town in San Diego where my good pal lives).</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/cali/alex.jpg" />
This is my good pal Alex. She hosted me and we had a great time.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/cali/turtles.jpg" />
From California, I drove alone to Las Cruces, a small town in New Mexico, because I was curious about New Mexico. Their nature museum housed tons of preciouses, like these turtles who made a pyramid for me.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/cali/sadhorse.jpg" />
Here is some art from the Las Cruces Art Museum. It was the only one that really packed an emotional punch for me. It was called ‘The Outsider,’ or something similar. The rest of the art was very land-based, as most Southwestern art is.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/cali/church.jpg" />
#no</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/houston/fitfam.jpg" />
From NM, I drove across Texas because I’ve always wanted to do that. I met my family at my uncle’s retirement home near Houston. I just want everyone to know that we work out in between eating chili and Thai food.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/houston/pool.jpg" />
From our swimming pool photoshoot</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/houston/cat.jpg" />
A few days in Houston well spent were followed by a few days in Columbus. I stayed at Taylor and Tommy’s lovely house and didn’t get any pictures of them, but I DID think to get a photo of this cat that hangs out on their porch that Taylor is not a fan of.</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/houston/model.jpg" />
Part of the reason for my Columbus visit was to get a professional photoshoot of people wearing Fabric of Space-Time. We are currently digging through the photos and designing a website and branding. Stay tuned!</p>

<p><img src="../../img/travels/houston/radiohead.jpg" />
The other reason I came to Columbus was to see Radiohead for the third time. A bad picture of my favorite band.</p>

<p>All in all, I don't know exactly what I'm doing, but I'm lucky to be doing it. Thanks for reading.</p>
